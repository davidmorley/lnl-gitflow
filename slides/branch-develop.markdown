* always reflects code to be included in the next release <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" -->
* nobody commits! <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" -->
* nightly builds <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" -->

Note: In contrast to the master branch, the HEAD of develop contains the code that has been approved for the next release. In Scrum terms, that would mean any code that is "done done" and has received approval to be included in the next production release.
