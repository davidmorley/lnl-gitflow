##git-flow: permanent branches
<span>master</span> <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in small" -->

<span>develop</span> <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in small" -->

Note: git-flow defines two "permanent" branches. They are permanent in the sense that they are created at the beginning of a project and are never deleted. These two branches are the master branch and the develop branch. Over the next few slides, we will learn the purpose of each one.
