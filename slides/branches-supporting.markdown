Note: In addition to the permanent branches (master and develop), there are three types of several transient supporting branches described in git-flow. These branches have separate, defined lifecycles; they are created at specific times, for specific purposes, and once those purposes have been accomplished, they are destroyed. The three types are: feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches. Let's look at each one on its own.
